# tinyos-wsn-simulation
In the TinyOS development environment, generate simulation files for simulation. Write the simulation script to realize the sending and receiving of data in the sensor network (at least three nodes). The simulation process is recorded in the log log. After the simulation, the log log is analyzed to calculate the packet loss rate and delay of the data
